Build a website that provides senior citizens with a one-stop for the 
services they can avail on the Internet (Jeevan Pramaan 
Registration, medicine reminder, tutorials on Internet services –
social media, senior citizen services, YouTube, etc.)
Senior citizens sometimes find making use of the Internet difficult. 
Your app should be something which is simple to use and intuitive, 
and at the same time, provide a senior citizen with features like –
send notifications when important events by the government related 
to senior citizens are coming up (example: deadline for applying for 
Jeevan pramaan), redirect senior citizen to the appropriate site to get 
government service, teach the senior citizens some of the capabilities 
of the Internet – social media, videos, etc. through tutorials, help the 
senior citizen (or guardian) configure notifications on the app which 
will remind the time to take a medicine, or an upcoming general 
appointment, etc.
